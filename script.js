   "heading": "ABSTRACT",
   "body": "This thesis proposes a unification of the 'Hard Problem of Consciousness,' the philosophical problem of induction (Hume), the metaphysics of Advaita Vedanta, and the theological concept of the 'Final Judgment.' It posits that <strong>causality is a cognitive illusion</strong> generated by the observation of correlations at close temporal proximity. Consequently, 'Time' is a construct of this illusory causal chain. The thesis argues that the theological distinction between 'the living and the dead' refers not to biological status but to ontological states: 'the dead' are those bound by the illusion of linear causality (<em>Maya</em>), while 'the living' are those who have awakened to the immediacy of correlation (<em>Brahman</em>). The 'Second Coming' is reinterpreted as the asymptotic collapse of time (Δt → 0), resulting in the 'Eternal Now'. Crucially, this thesis redefines the Hard Problem of Consciousness not merely as a biological puzzle, but as the cognitive difficulty of shifting from the Temporal Script (Matter/Causality) to the Eternal Now (Mind/Correlation)."

    { "type": "paragraph", "text": "Current scientific models explain the functions of the brain but fail to explain the experience of the mind (The Hard Problem). Simultaneously, theological eschatology describes a 'Final Judgment' involving the separation of the 'living and the dead'. This research suggests these are not separate problems but mirror images of the same misunderstanding of Reality. The gap between Mind and Matter is identical to the gap between the 'Living' (Real) and the 'Dead' (Illusion)." },

The <strong>Cogitate Consortium's 2023 adversarial collaboration</strong>—spanning EEG, MEG, and intracranial recordings—has begun challenging classical integrated information and global workspace theories, hinting at non-local dynamics potentially quantum in origin. Resolution of the Hard Problem necessitates not novel neural mechanisms but an epistemic pivot from sequential causality to synchronic correlation." }
