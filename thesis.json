      "body": "This thesis proposes a unification of the 'Hard Problem of Consciousness,' the philosophical problem of induction (Hume), the metaphysics of Advaita Vedanta, and the theological concept of the 'Final Judgment.' It posits that <strong>causality is a cognitive illusion</strong> generated by the observation of correlations at close temporal proximity [64]. Consequently, 'Time' is a construct of this illusory causal chain [65]. The thesis argues that the theological distinction between 'the living and the dead' refers not to biological status but to ontological states: 'the dead' are those bound by the illusion of linear causality (<em>Maya</em>), while 'the living' are those who have awakened to the immediacy of correlation (<em>Brahman</em>) [66]. The 'Second Coming' is reinterpreted as the asymptotic collapse of time (Δt → 0), resulting in the 'Eternal Now' [67]. Crucially, this thesis redefines the Hard Problem of Consciousness not merely as a biological puzzle, but as the cognitive difficulty of shifting from the Temporal Script (Matter/Causality) to the Eternal Now (Mind/Correlation) [68]."

Simultaneously, theological eschatology describes a 'Final Judgment' involving the separation of the 'living and the dead' [75]. This research suggests these are not separate problems but mirror images of the same misunderstanding of Reality [76]. The gap between Mind and Matter is identical to the gap between the 'Living' (Real) and the 'Dead' (Illusion) [77]. Therefore, solving the Hard Problem requires not a new biological mechanism, but an ontological shift from linear causality to instantaneous correlation [78]." }
