      "body": "This thesis proposes a unification of the 'Hard Problem of Consciousness' [3], the philosophical problem of induction (Hume [1]), the metaphysics of Advaita Vedanta [8], and the theological concept of the 'Final Judgment' [2]. It posits that <strong>causality is a cognitive illusion</strong> generated by the observation of correlations at close temporal proximity. Consequently, 'Time' is a construct of this illusory causal chain. The thesis argues that the theological distinction between 'the living and the dead' refers not to biological status but to ontological states: 'the dead' are those bound by the illusion of linear causality (<em>Maya</em>), while 'the living' are those who have awakened to the immediacy of correlation (<em>Brahman</em>). The 'Second Coming' is reinterpreted as the asymptotic collapse of time (Δt → 0), resulting in the 'Eternal Now'. Crucially, this thesis redefines the Hard Problem of Consciousness not merely as a biological puzzle, but as the cognitive difficulty of shifting from the Temporal Script (Matter/Causality) to the Eternal Now (Mind/Correlation)."
